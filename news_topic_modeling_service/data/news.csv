I wanted to keep losing. And instead I’m back to not being comfortable. So I felt ashamed.

The prognosis?\n\nShe lives! Whew.\n\nHere’s how it went down: During Thursday’s episode, Matthew (Justin Bruening) is brought into the hospital after rolling his car, revealing that April (Sarah Drew) was also in the vehicle with him. Yes, after the death of Matthew’s wife, April reunited with her ex-fiancé.\n\nThe doctors spend the hour trying to warm April’s body before attempting to revive her. Meredith is quick to point out that she went through the same thing — remember the ferry boat crash and the Denny and Coach-filled purgatory? — but was in much worse shape, so there’s still hope for April. Owen calls on everyone to pray for April, knowing it’s what she would want, and it appears to work, as they’re able to revive April by hour’s end.\n\nAlso during the hour, Arizona (Jessica Capshaw) turns in her resignation, revealing to Bailey (Chandra Wilson) that she’s moving to New York so Sofia can be closer to her other mom, Callie (Sara Ramirez). But there’s a curveball thrown in her plans when Dr. Herman (Geena Davis) returns and discovers that Arizona is leaving fetal surgery for peds because of her move. Herman then says she got a grant and wants to open a joint venture with Arizona, called the Robbins-Herman Center, where they can teach new fetal doctors. Herman even agrees to open it in New York. So now viewers know Arizona gets her happy ending ahead of Capshaw’s exit from the series, while April’s exit will likely be explained in next week’s season finale.\n\nThe season finale of Grey’s Anatomy will air Thursday, May 17, at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.","class":"U.S."}

Well, that’s not entirely true. He’s perfectly at home criticizing other people, or making sure they know what’s bothering him at any given moment. Genuine, earnest, heartfelt emotions though? Those aren’t for Sheldon Cooper. He’s a man of science, and one who struggles to understand social cues and norms. In the early seasons of The Big Bang Theory it was unthinkable that anybody could survive living with him, never mind actually beginning a romantic relationship that might lead to marriage.\n\nThe Big Bang Theory isn’t strictly the story of Sheldon Cooper — it’s a sitcom, so there’s not much of an overarching story in general — but his journey encapsulates a lot of what this show is about, or at least what it’s morphed into. The show underwent a significant change when it added Mayim Bialik and Melissa Rauch as series regulars, their presence a boon for the show, allowing it to explore more mature stories. Yes, the “nerd” humor was still there in spades, but so was a renewed focus on relationships, marriage, responsibility, and the necessity of adapting to change as one gets older.\n\nAt the heart of that change is Sheldon Cooper, the man most resistant to it. He’s grown a lot across 11 seasons. He’s still obnoxious and selfish, but he’s learning to be better to the people around him. That growth is evident throughout “The Bow Tie Asymmetry,” the season 11 finale that finally sees Sheldon and Amy tie the knot. There’s none of the cruel humor that defines some episodes, and no romantic plans derailed by something silly or that suggests Sheldon is uncaring. Instead, this is about as straightforward as The Big Bang Theory gets, and that’s a good thing.\n\nRELATED: Get the lowdown on the Emmys with EW’s CHASING EMMY podcast\n\nIt’s a good thing because it allows the characters, and the marriage, to take center stage. With a Saturday wedding all planned and ready to go, Penny is running point and keeping everyone organized. While the rest of the group can’t decide on a nerdy movie metaphor to describe their current duties, Penny is making sure they all understand what they’re supposed to be doing to keep the wedding on schedule.\n\nDoing so isn’t all that easy, especially when parents are involved. Penny picks up Amy’s parents, played by Kathy Bates and Teller of Penn and Teller, from the airport and gets a quick introduction to their particular dynamic. In other words, Amy’s mother has trouble uttering sentences that aren’t judgments and insults, and Amy’s father has trouble uttering sentences in general.\n\nRaj doesn’t fare much better with Sheldon’s mother and sister, who spend most of the ride passive aggressively attacking each other over the fact that Sheldon’s sister is pregnant and separated from her husband. By the time they get back to the apartment, Penny is exhausted, but everyone else is excited to see the family and finally begin the day-long celebration.\n\nBefore the wedding can get started though, The Big Bang Theory has to set up two surprises. The first sees Howard find a lost dog, and when he calls the owner to come pick it up, he discovers that he’s found Mark Hamill’s dog. Returning “Bark Hamill” to his owner is a dream come true, but the interaction doesn’t end there. Hamill wants to pay Howard back somehow, and that’s when he comes up with an idea. He rushes over to Stuart’s comic book store and tells him that he’s convinced Mark Hamill to officiate Sheldon and Amy’s wedding. That prompts Alice, who Stuart’s asked to accompany him to the wedding, to agree to the date, setting up the episode’s second surprise: Stuart may legitimately have found someone who thinks fondly of him.

Read at your own risk!\n\nThe Big Bang Theory closed out its 11th season with the star-studded wedding of Sheldon and Amy — but one guest in particular stole the show.\n\nFirst off, yes, Mark Hamill surprise-officiated the wedding. And in any other circumstance, we’d be as starstruck as Sheldon (Jim Parsons) was upon realizing that Luke Skywalker would take part in his big day with Amy (Mayim Bialik). However, the finale also provided a shocking moment that many fans never thought they’d see, and it had to do with magician Teller.\n\nAs part of the wedding extravaganza, Kathy Bates made her debut as Amy’s overbearing mom, who would steamroll over her father any time he tried to speak — a running joke made all the more hilarious because Amy’s father was portrayed by the famously silent magician.\n\nBut The Big Bang Theory did what seemed impossible, getting Teller to actually speak on camera. After his wife tussles with Penny (Kaley Cuoco), Mrs. Fowler encourages him to take action. “Are you going to let her talk to me like that?” she says. “Say something!” Mr. Fowler responds directly to Penny, whispering, “Thank you.”\n\nMichael Yarish/CBS\n\nIt’s brief, but momentous. Those two words are more than most have ever heard Teller speak. This wasn’t his first public speaking, mind you — he has briefly spoken on a number of occasions in the past, it’s just a rare occurrence. “He was super-game, and he’s a friend of the show,” executive producer Steve Holland tells EW. “We know he’s a fan, we’ve met him before, he’s come to the set before, and so actually it seems like we wrote the role specifically for him, but we didn’t.\n\n“When we were writing Amy’s mom and dad, it just seemed funny that Amy’s mom kept stepping on Amy’s dad every time he tried to speak,” Holland continues. “About halfway through writing, one of the writers, Jeremy Howe, said, ‘Teller would be really funny for this.’ And it just clicked. You’re like, absolutely. This feels like it was intentional, like we did this just for that, but it seemed like such the perfect fit, so we contacted him and he was super-excited about doing it. He was actually bouncing back and forth. He was directing a play in Chicago and doing his Penn and Teller show in Vegas, but he was like, ‘Don’t worry. We’ll work out the logistics. I really want to be there to do this.’”\n\nAnd yes, Teller really did speak to Holland. He really does speak! But there was a moment, briefly, when they weren’t going to include his voice — though not due to any objections on Teller’s part. “When we shot it, we did a couple different versions of it, but no, he never pushed back or was reluctant to do the line at all,” Holland says. “We did a bigger, fuller-voiced version, we did the version that you saw [in the finale], and we did a version where he only mouthed it but didn’t vocalize anything — the whispered version seemed to be the funniest.”\n\nMichael Yarish/CBS\n\nAt the close of the finale, Sheldon and Amy got married with nary a cliffhanger in sight — well, save for the fact that the newlyweds discovered the game-changing super-asymmetry. “We don’t know what the future holds, whether next season will be the end or not, but it’s always been a thing that we’ve talked about, giving Sheldon a big win at some point,” Holland says. “We’ve said for 11 years that he’s one of the smartest people in the world, so I think it’s important for us to show that at some point, and to have it be a thing that he and Amy have done together. This breakthrough will certainly play through next season.”\n\nWhile the episode concluded with Amy and Sheldon officially being hitched, there was a post-nuptials scene that ended up on the cutting room floor. EW was on set for the taping of the finale, and witnessed a scene that pays tribute to the late scientist Stephen Hawking, who had previously appeared on the show on several occasions. As Amy and Sheldon celebrate having Hamill’s signature on their marriage license, Leonard (Johnny Galecki) and Penny bring in more wedding presents, one of which they realize was sent by Hawking before his death. Both cheeky and heartfelt, the gift speaks to Hawking’s importance to the characters of the show. Find out what the gift is when CBS releases the video Friday.\n\nThe Big Bang Theory will return this fall on CBS.","class":"U.S."}

Gassnola pleaded guilty to one felony count of wire fraud conspiracy.\n\nAn Adidas spokesperson called Skechers' complaint \"frivolous and nonsensical\" and said \"it should be summarily dismissed.\"\n\nAdidas executive Jim Gatto and employee Merl Code were among 10 men arrested by FBI agents in late September, following a two-year investigation into bribes and other corruption in college basketball. Among other charges, the government alleges Gatto, Code and Christian Dawkins, a runner for former NBA agent Andy Miller, conspired to make improper payments to ensure that high school players signed with Adidas-sponsored colleges and then inked endorsement deals with the shoe company once they turned pro.\n\nLast month, federal prosecutors filed additional charges against the men, alleging they also conspired to provide cash payments to the families of former basketball players at Kansas, Louisville and NC State.\n\nThey are scheduled to go on trial at U.S. District Court in New York in October.\n\nAlso last month, Thomas \"T.J.\" Gassnola, an Adidas consultant from Springfield, Massachusetts, was indicted and pleaded guilty to one felony count of wire fraud conspiracy for his role in the alleged bribery schemes. The former director of the Adidas-sponsored New England Playaz has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in the federal government's investigation, according to court records.\n\nSkechers' lawsuit claims that Adidas' alleged misbehavior has irreparably harmed its footing in the basketball marketplace.\n\n\"The competitive harm of adidas' egregious misconduct is substantial,\" the lawsuit says. \"The market for basketball shoes is driven as much by brand perception, attitude, and style as it is by shoe performance. The ability to develop 'street credibility' by having talented players and trendsetters wear a company's shoes can make or break a brand's reputation.\n\n\"Some of the key ways that law-abiding shoe companies get their products on players' feet are through sponsoring youth basketball programs, sponsoring college/university sports programs, and through endorsement deals with professional players in the NBA. adidas' illicit bribery program, however, has corrupted all of these channels, tipping the scales unfairly in adidas' favor to the detriment of competitors, including Skechers.\"\n\nAdidas and Skechers have struggled to keep up with Nike in the $1 billion performance basketball market. According to data from research firm NPD Group, Nike owned 73.5 percent of the performance basketball market in 2017, followed by Under Armour at 12.1 percent and Nike-owned Jordan Brand at 7.8 percent. Adidas was fourth with a 4.8-percent share.\n\nSales figures for Skechers in the performance basketball market weren't immediately available.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Skechers' lawyers said NBA players Jamal Crawford (who left for a more lucrative deal with Adidas) and Josh Smith wore its shoes in the past. Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and former NBA stars Karl Malone, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Larry Bird have also endorsed Skechers' shoes, according to the lawsuit.\n\nAdidas and Skechers have had an acrimonious relationship over the past two decades. On Thursday, a U.S. appeals court ruled that Adidas can protect its famous Stan Smith tennis shoe and decided that an alleged Skechers knockoff looked too much like the famous all-white shoe. The court did reverse a similar injunction that banned Skechers from selling a shoe that mimicked Adidas' three-stripe design.\n\n\"We had no doubt the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals would affirm that Skechers has engaged in unlawful and infringing behavior,\" the Adidas spokesperson said in a statement. \"The Court also recognized that Skechers did so in bad faith and with full knowledge of adidas' prior rights. We will not stand by and allow others to blatantly copy our products and infringe on our valuable intellectual property. We remain invested in protecting our rights and committed to bringing a complete end to Skechers' pattern of unlawful conduct at next month's trial.\"","class":"U.S."}

(1:09)\n\nNot many people understand the Ben Roethlisberger-Mason Rudolph dynamic better than Tommy Maddox, a former starting quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers who graciously handled the handoff to the rookie Roethlisberger in 2004.\n\nFourteen years later, after Roethlisberger aired displeasure over the team's selection of Rudolph in the third round, Maddox believes Roethlisberger might not owe it to Rudolph to mentor him -- but he won't shun him, either.\n\n\"I think Ben will treat him with respect,\" Maddox told ESPN from his classroom at Decatur (Texas) High School, where he serves as the head baseball coach and is preparing for the playoffs. \"His No. 1 goal is to get ready to play and help the team be successful.\n\nEditor's Picks Rudolph shrugs off Big Ben 'help now' remark Steelers draft pick Mason Rudolph said he understands where Ben Roethlisberger's comments came from after the future Hall of Famer downplayed the former Oklahoma State quarterback's addition to Pittsburgh.\n\nBig Ben hedges on mentoring QB Rudolph Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was surprised the Steelers selected Mason Rudolph in the third round of the draft. Roethlisberger had informed management early in the offseason that he planned to play at least three more years. 1 Related\n\n\"I've heard a lot of people say he owes it. That kind of gets into a little bit of a slippery slope. His job is to win football games right now. But, with that said, I think everybody in the locker room, the more it gets along, the better this team is going to be.\"\n\nRoethlisberger, 36, said on his radio show last week that he was surprised by the Rudolph selection over a player who could potentially \"help this team now.\"\n\nAsked about mentoring Rudolph, Roethlisberger said that won't be necessary since Rudolph says he doesn't need the veteran.\n\n\"If he asks me a question, I might just have to point to the playbook,\" Roethlisberger said with a laugh, later acknowledging he would probably answer questions.\n\nRudolph -- who told the media on draft night that it's his job to learn and it's not up to Roethlisberger to teach him -- was diplomatic in his response, telling NFL Network over the weekend he'd probably react the same way is he were in Roethlisberger's position.\n\nDuring Roethlisberger's rookie year, Maddox entered the season as the starter but hurt his throwing arm in Week 2 against the Baltimore Ravens. Roethlisberger, the 11th overall pick, took over and the team never looked back.\n\nThis week, Sports Illustrated unearthed a Roethlisberger quote from 2005, as told to USA Today, praising Maddox's role in the transition: \"He'll meet me halfway out on the field to answer a question for me. I owe so much of my success to his help.\"\n\nTommy Maddox, who was the incumbent, helped Ben Roethlisberger with the transition of becoming a rookie starting quarterback with the Steelers in 2004. David Maxwell/Getty Images\n\nMaddox said he learned a lot from that experience and helped Roethlisberger because it was best for the team. But this situation, with a Hall of Fame-caliber quarterback still playing at a high level, is a bit different.\n\n\"Everybody's going to handle things differently. I'm not going to sit here and say I think Ben owes it to him to [mentor],\" said Maddox, who played nine NFL seasons and won comeback player of the year in 2002 after stints in the XFL and AFL. \"I think all of us, when you're playing, you owe it to your teammates to be respectful and do what's best for the team and all that.\n\n\"I don't think it's a situation where Ben owes it or that's his job or whatever. But it is his job as a leader of the team to lead the team and make sure there's no distractions.\"\n\nMaddox, now 46, assumes Roethlisberger was simply responding to a situation that surprised him. The initial shock tends to fade when everyone comes to work, Maddox said, but that doesn't make the concept of quarterback mortality any easier to handle.\n\nThe Steelers have drafted quarterbacks in back-to-back years as insurance while Roethlisberger plays into his late 30s.\n\n\"Sooner or later, your day will come and someone else will be playing,\" Maddox said. \"For many guys, that's hard to consider. But it's coming eventually.\"\n\nMaddox understands Rudolph's predicament. He remembers John Elway's unhappiness with the Denver Broncos' selection of Maddox with the 25th pick in the 1992 draft. Elway hoped for receiver help but got Maddox instead.\n\nAdvice for the rookie?\n\n\"Be yourself, go about your business, do the things that you need to do,\" Maddox said. \"Kind of control what you can.\"","class":"World"}

It hasn't worked out that way, with only one true superstar coming out of this draft class, a couple of very solid every-day players, and just one consistent major league starting pitcher -- who was drafted in the 25th round.\n\nThis re-draft is based on two major criteria: the players' careers to date and my projections of value they still have to offer (though the list does include players whose careers are likely over). I did not account for signability at the time, nor did I consider a team's preference for high school or college players, pitchers versus position players, etc. In other words, this analysis is based purely on talent. The first overall pick from 2008, prep shortstop Tim Beckham, did not make the list of the top 30 players from the draft crop; he will lead off my look at the 2008 draft first-round misses. (By the way, you can see my past re-drafts for 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002 as well.)\n\nThis ranking includes only players who were drafted and signed in 2008. That means some well-known major leaguers, such as Anthony Rendon, Jason Kipnis, George Springer and Gerrit Cole, who were drafted that year but didn't sign, aren't eligible for this list. Their day will come.\n\nOn to the re-drafted first round of the 2008 draft:\n\n1.

He went fifth. Posey hit .463/.566/.879 for Florida State and won the Golden Spikes Award in 2008, and was a catcher -- he'd been a shortstop and reliever as a freshman before moving behind the plate full time his sophomore year -- but somehow wasn't the first college player taken or selected in the top four picks.

Ricardo Diaz isn't playing around anymore. Ricardo Diaz isn't playing around anymore.\n\nWarning: Full spoilers for the episode below.\n\nRicardo Diaz failed in his attempt to get Oliver Queen locked behind bars last week, so now he’s resorted to the time-honored tradition established by Arrow villains of seasons past - kill the Green Arrow and everyone he loves. It’s definitely that time of year. “The Ties That Bind” proved to be a solid lead-in to the finale, though there’s a nagging sense that the series is still overly shy about breaking its toys.\n\nThe opening scenes set the tone nicely, with each member of Team Arrow enjoying some quality time with their loved ones (save for poor, lonely Dinah) before being rudely interrupted by Diaz’s kill squads. There’s been a lot of teasing and hinting in recent weeks that the show’s status quo will change dramatically in Season 7. At the very least, this episode made it clear that our heroes will need a new base of operations. Both the bunker and Ollie’s swanky apartment are pretty much toast.\n\nArrow: \"The Ties that Bind\" Photos 10+ IMAGES Fullscreen Image Artboard 3 Copy Artboard 3 ESC 01 13 Stephen Amell as Oliver Queen/Green Arrow in Arrow's \"The Ties that Bind\" Episode 01 13 Stephen Amell as Oliver Queen/Green Arrow in Arrow's \"The Ties that Bind\" Episode Arrow: \"The Ties that Bind\" Photos The CW Download Image Captions ESC\n\nBut while there was plenty of property damage to go around this week, the physical toll take on our heroes was fairly minimal. That’s my one big complaint here. So much was made of the all-encompassing threat posed by Diaz and his army of loyal police officers, yet Team Arrow survived multiple encounters with the enemy at little cost. At worst, Curtis and his boyfriend both suffered non-life-threatening injuries. At some point the show struggles to establish a sense of stakes and danger when these characters start to feel invincible. It doesn’t really help that Lyla was so quick to provide a disposable army of ARGUS redshirts when the situation called for it.\n\nNot that I necessarily feel one or more Team Arrow members absolutely have to die to give the finale weight, but I think we need some reminder of the threat Diaz poses. And given how badly this season started off on the wrong fitting by wasting Season 5’s dramatic cliffhanger, it would sure be a nice mea culpa if it managed to up the drama and danger here at the end.\n\nAll that aside, this episode still offered a compelling look at the endgame of Team Arrow’s war with Diaz. After all the bumps our heroes have hit in recent months, there is a certain satisfaction in seeing them reunited and working as a cohesive fighting force again. Not to mention the appeal in seeing Lyla take center stage and get her hands dirty. There was also just enough focus on Ollie’s struggle to find focus as a superhero without distracting from the larger drama of the Diaz conflict. Even with the series focusing on the full ensemble cast again, the writers seem to be doing a better job of finding balance and maintaining forward momentum.\n\nIt’s also a lot of fun to see Diaz grow unhinged. Where once he was the careful, methodical mastermind lurking behind the scenes, he’s basically gone full supervillain at this point. It’s clear that’s going to be his undoing in the finale, as his pride and inferiority complex finally get the better of him. Kirk Acevedo is bringing a newfound intensity to his role. Even if our heroes never really felt like they were in mortal danger this week, Diaz himself oozes danger.\n\nIt was also nice to see so much emphasis on Anatoly this week. I didn’t particularly enjoy his presence early on this season, as it often felt like he was being kept around solely to have another familiar face on Cayden James’ crew. But that’s changed in recent weeks as Anatoly has become torn between his desire for power and money and his need to be the honorable man he always claims to be. If any major character is going to die next week, it’s probably him. And it has all the potential to be a great death, capping off a multi-season arc and proving Ollie was right to put his faith in Anatoly.\n\nExit Theatre Mode\n\nOne other thing this episode made pretty clear is that the Quadrant probably won’t be sticking around as a lasting threat in Star City. Diaz made sure of that by killing two of its four leaders. While on one hand that only elevates him as a threat and illuminates his sadistic state of mind, it doesn’t do much to establish the Quadrant as a credible threat in the Arrowverse. Why do these seemingly all-powerful crime lords leave themselves in the position to be murdered so easily? Why is there no retaliation against Diaz? It feels like more could have been done with this shadowy organization. On the other hand, perhaps the inevitable power vacuum in the criminal underworld will be one of the driving forces of Season 7.\n\nThis episode included one more unexpected swerve with the last-minute return of Agent Watson, now apparently a reluctant ally to the Green Arrow. It’ll be interesting to see what her second request is. There’s also the question of what sort of legal jeopardy Ollie opened himself up to by admitting he’s the Green Arrow. After all this, could he still wind up going to prison in the end? An intriguing thought, though it would just add to the disappointment in how “Docket No. 11-19-41-73” resolved itself last week.","class":"U.S."}
